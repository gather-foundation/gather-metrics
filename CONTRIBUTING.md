## Pull Requests

### Technical Requirements

- Linting and Type Hints:
Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards. Run linters, formatters and Mypy before submitting your PR. Feel free to setup the pre-commit and mypy configuration from the repo.

- Branching:
Submit all pull requests against the `development` branch. Documentation updates can be made against main.

- No Compiled Files:
Avoid including compiled files or static assets in your PR. Only submit source files.

- Testing:
Include relevant tests in the `/tests` directory. Ensure that all tests pass before submitting your PR.

- Commit Structure:
Feel free to use multiple commits for clarity. We will squash commits when merging.

- Review Process:

1. Open Discussion:
PRs are open for discussion, but please ensure that major feature additions have been discussed via an issue beforehand.

2. Keep PRs Focused:
Small, focused PRs are easier to review and more likely to be merged quickly. Large, unfocused PRs may be split or closed with recommendations on how to proceed.

3. Bugfixes:
Direct PRs for bug fixes are welcome, especially for issues already documented. If you're unsure whether something is a bug, open an issue for clarification before submitting a fix.

- Avoid Unsolicited Refactors:
Refactoring PRs without functional changes will generally be closed unless specifically requested.

## Additional Contribution Guidelines

- Documentation:
Contributions to the documentation are always welcome. Improving clarity, fixing typos, and adding new examples are great ways to help the community.

- Community Contributions:
There are many ways to contribute beyond code. Improving docs, suggesting usage patterns, and helping other users in the community are all valuable contributions.

- Communication:
If you believe an issue or PR was closed incorrectly, or you have additional questions, please reach out to our team at [developers@gatherfoundation.ch](mailto:developers@gatherfoundation.ch) or re-open the discussion respectfully.
